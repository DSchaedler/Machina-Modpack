# Machina-Modpack
This repository is home to the Machina Modpack, a modpack for Minecraft. It is designed for Minecraft version 1.10.2. I do not plan on releasing versions for other versions of Minecraft.

## This Modpack is a Work In Progress!!
I don't yet have a version I am comfortable releasing. This Modpack may be unstable.

## This repository is a Work In Progress!!
This means that all of the information on the pack is not availible, or may be inaccurate.

## Modpack Usage Information
You may use this modpack however you please, just please retain any credits and support links when distributing or modifying it. I ask that if you make a large change to the pack, you simply make another pack not associated with this one.

Smaller changes can be submitted to this repository for review.

## About this Pack
This pack is designed to be played in singleplayer, multiplayer or team-multiplayer. Please note that Simple Achievements has global achievements; meaning that if one player on a server changes the completion status, it changes for everyone.

Players should find this pack to be a good balance between vanilla minecraft, technology oriented packs, and qualtiy of life additions. I purposely excluded mods that make the base game harder, or have glaring incompatibilities with standardized systems.

### Mods that I will never add:
 * Railcraft - Railcraft goes over the top with it's complexity, and makes early-game minecart systems too complex.
 * Industrial Craft 2 - This mod should be compatible with Redstone Flux, but isn't. Other mods like Botania and Extra Utilities have power systems that feel like they aren't meant to interact. But IC2 feels like it should work, and doesn't.

## Todo List
 * Finish tweaking the pack for an Alpha version.
 * Upload the pack in a way that does not violate any mod licences.
 * Create a Wiki for pack specific changes.
 * Create a Website to act as a landing page for the Pack.
 * Set-up the issue tracker.
 * Set-up the changelog.
 
## Known Issues
 * The world generates two different kinds of Iron Ore.
